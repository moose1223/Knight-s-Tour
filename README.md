# Knight's Tour
#This is an old homework assignment uploaded to github for releveant projects for job hiring processes.  Most of the files were written by my proffessor, Dr. Nick Breems.  
Only the KnightsTourSolver was written by me.  The program will ask for n for a nXn board, and then what row and what column to start from.  
From there it shall try to solve the knight's tour puzzle, and return the solved board, as well as how long it took to solve.

If you want to look at the code that I have written, look at the KnightsTourSolver.java file.
